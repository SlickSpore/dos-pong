## DOS-PONG

DOS-PONG is an open source game based on the 1972's original **[Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)**.

This Game was coded in `C89`, with the use of `Open Watcom` and [`Mode 13h`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h)

This game is not, and it is not going to be, a well coded version of Pong for DOS, but it was fun to Code it :)...

This version is `32 bit`, and should work fine on Pentium III... 
I used [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) as the main DOS os..
