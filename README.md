DOS-PONG is an open source game hardly inspired by 1972's original **[Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)**.

This Game was programmed in `C89`, with `Open Watcom`  compiler and [`Mode 13h`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_13h), for the graphics...

This game **is not**, and it is not going to be, a well coded version of Pong for DOS, but it was fun Coding it :) ...soooo

This version is `32 bit`, and should work fine on Pentium III... 
I used [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) as the main DOS os..
## Installing
The installing process is fairly staight forward:

 - Plug the **.iso** file directly into the VM, or the Computer.
 - Download Repo's **.zip** file, extract it, and copy the `dospong` folder to your pc.
 

> I wont try this game on a real machine btw.
## Playing It!

 - To play this game, you just need to be in the folder containing
   `dospong.exe` and you can run it by typing `dospong` on the terminal
   
 Commands:
 
 - P1: 					`CTRL` 		and `ALT`.
 - P2: 					`LARROW` 	and `RARROW`
 - RESUME:		`2x SPACE`
 - EXIT: 				`ESC`

The maximum score is 9, than the game will pause and you need to press `SPACE` to restart.
